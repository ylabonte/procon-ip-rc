# How to contribute
The most common way will be by forking the repo, making your changes and 
creating pull requests on my repo. 

If you wish to participate into the whole development process, feel free to 
contact me (eg. via mail: yannic.labonte@gmail.com). 
We might introduce a proper workflow (eg. using github projects to colaborative
coordinate/plan the project and a git-flow strategy with mutual code reviews
to increase code quality and automatically keep us up-to-date about what the
other does).
